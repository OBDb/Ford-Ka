generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1996
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The original Ford Ka was a revolutionary small car designed by Claude Lobo and Chris Svensson, featuring distinctive 'New Edge' styling with unusual circular headlamps and prominent wheel arches. Built on a shortened version of the Mk4 Fiesta platform, it was characterized by its compact dimensions (just 3.6 meters long) and light weight (under 950 kg). Powered primarily by a 1.3L Endura-E engine with 59 HP, it emphasized fun handling over straight-line performance with responsive steering and a playful chassis. The minimalist interior featured exposed painted metal, unique circular design elements, and basic equipment levels to keep costs down. Later special editions added more features and unique styling. Despite its age, the first-generation Ka maintained strong sales throughout its unusually long 12-year production run, establishing itself as a style icon and popular choice for city driving. Over 1.4 million units were produced of this generation."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The second-generation Ka abandoned the distinctive styling of its predecessor for a more conventional design based on the Fiat 500/Panda platform, developed in partnership with Fiat and built in Poland. Slightly larger than its predecessor, it was powered by either a 1.2L petrol engine with 69 HP or a 1.3L diesel with 75 HP, both Fiat-sourced units. The interior featured a more modern design with improved materials and available features including Bluetooth connectivity and voice control. A performance-oriented Ka Sport model with a 1.6L engine was offered in some markets. While this generation offered improved refinement, safety, and equipment levels compared to its predecessor, it lost some of the original's character and unique positioning. European production ended in 2016, though the model continued in South America as the Ka+ with different specifications."

  - name: "Third Generation (Ka+)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The final European Ka, renamed Ka+, was significantly larger than previous generations, positioning it as a value-oriented alternative in the B-segment rather than an A-segment city car. Based on the global Ford platform used for the Fiat Figo and developed primarily for emerging markets like India and Brazil, it featured conventional five-door hatchback styling. Powered by a 1.2L three-cylinder Ti-VCT engine with either 70 or 85 HP in most European markets, it emphasized practicality and value over style or driving dynamics. The interior was significantly more spacious than previous Ka models, with improved equipment including SYNC 3 infotainment on higher trims. A crossover-inspired 'Active' variant with raised ride height and body cladding was added in 2018. This generation represented a significant shift in the Ka's positioning, losing the distinctive character of the original model in favor of practicality and affordability. Declining sales and changing emissions regulations led to its discontinuation in Europe in 2019, though production continued in some markets."
